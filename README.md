# Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) Generation Tool

## Introduction

This repository houses the source code for a comprehensive SBOM generation tool. The tool is designed to automate the process of creating a Software Bill of Materials for custom-developed software, aiding in compliance, security assessments, and supply chain management.

## Description

### Problem Statement Title

The objective of this project is to design, develop, and implement a software tool capable of generating a detailed SBOM for custom-developed software. The tool should automatically identify and list various libraries, dependencies, and modules used in the development process. It should also include features to flag anomalies and provide contextual information to users. Evaluation criteria include the automation level, granularity, accuracy, version identification, ease of use, and user experience.

### Use Cases of SBOM

1. **Compliance Review**
   - *Definition:* Ensure adherence to legal, regulatory, and internal compliance standards.
   - *Use Case:* Conduct audits to confirm that software components comply with licensing, copyright, and regulatory requirements.

2. **Security Assessments**
   - *Definition:* Evaluate and manage security risks associated with software components.
   - *Use Case:* Identify and mitigate vulnerabilities by analyzing the SBOM to understand the security posture and potential risks introduced by each component.

3. **License Compliance**
   - *Definition:* Manage and verify software licenses to prevent legal issues.
   - *Use Case:* Track and validate licenses for each software component to ensure compliance with licensing agreements and avoid legal complications.

4. **Quality Assurance**
   - *Definition:* Ensure the reliability, stability, and overall quality of the software.
   - *Use Case:* Use the SBOM to conduct quality assurance checks, including version tracking, to maintain the integrity of the software and prevent issues related to outdated or incompatible components.

5. **Supply Chain Security**
   - *Definition:* Safeguard against security threats introduced through the software supply chain.
   - *Use Case:* Verify the origins and security postures of third-party software components to mitigate the risk of malicious or compromised elements.

## Organization

This project is initiated by the National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO).

## How It Works

1. **File Upload:** Provide three files for processing.
2. **Web Scraping:** Use a web scraper to gather data on libraries, dependencies, and modules used in the software.
3. **Augmented Generation:** Employ the model for augmented data generation.
4. **Output Format:** Generate output in JSON files.
5. **CPE ID Extraction:** Extract CPE IDs from the generated data.
6. **NVD Database Search:** Use CPE IDs to search for vulnerabilities in the NVD database.
